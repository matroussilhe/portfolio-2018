    "description": "Sleek is a startup which offers online company secretary services. They provide a two-sided web platform. One side for the clients, one side for the corporate secretary admins.\n\nMy main contribution to the platform was maintaining and improving the API, refactoring the access control system, and building an automated reminding and renewing (billing) system. As the deadline for Sleek new service (e-signature) was approaching I switched to this project to speed up the development. My final task was the complete rework of the UI. We switched to a whole new stack (React to Vue). We built a lighter, faster and more maintainable UI.",

You have to wander through a dark city to find her.\n\nThe second game \"Elements Ritual\" is a FPS. There are two enemies AI, one shoot from distance when they see you. The other one is melee fighter than roll up and explode before they die. You basically have to shoot your way through the levels and beat the boss to win the game.",
