I built a website to easily manage your client base and generate various contracts and reports. Data is hierarchically structured and presented in a clear way. A fuzzy-search bar allow you to quickly find what youâ€™re looking for. There is also a data table where you get a big picture of your client base and perform global search.",

I took part in two of them as a programmer working with game designers and artists. In both projects I did AI and game programming.\n\nThe first game \"Lost my Mom\" tells the story of a boy who lost his mom. You see the world through the eyes of a terrified child. You have to wander through a dark city to find her.\n\nThe second game \"Elements Ritual\" is a FPS. There are two enemies AI, one shoot from distance when they see you. The other one is melee fighter than roll up and explode before they die. You basically have to shoot your way through the levels and beat the boss to win the game.",

We were six developers, spread all over the world during half this duration. I developed the playlist and the web browser both client and server side.",
