Add the light effect for 3D and realism",

          "description": "We needed a scalable and reliable solution to index and search our good items. Using Google Vision API we can analyse the artwork our users upload and assign them tags and colors. For tags, we get only the ones with a high (>60% of certainty) score. Because our users are Korean speaking, the tags are then translated into Korean using Google Traduction API. Each tags are then inserted into our DB and the most common appear first in the autocomplete when searching. For color we use parse from Google Vision API the most common color in terms of presence (number of pixels), and of focus (center of image, higher focus etc). These colors are then matched with a custom palette of ours. This palette is then used for filtering. So now in addition to filtering per category of item, we can also filter per color. We can then search for these tags in the search bar in addition to strings such as artist or artwork name. We can search either for items or artwork.",

One side for the clients, one side for the corporate secretary admins.\n\nMy main contribution to the platform was maintaining and improving the API, refactoring the access control system, and building an automated reminding and renewing (billing) system. As the deadline for Sleek new service (e-signature) was approaching I switched to this project to speed up the development. My final task was the complete rework of the UI. We switched to a whole new stack (React to Vue). We built a lighter, faster and more maintainable UI.",
